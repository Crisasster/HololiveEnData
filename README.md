# HololiveEnData
This is my final project for Code Louisville, Software Development 2.
This project is made in a console app .net file using visual studio.
It also uses the nuget packages SQLite and and system.data.sqlite
Most of the code can be found in the SQLite folder.
You will need to create your own Sqlite connection string and add it where it says //your connection here
I set up my connection string using the sqlite compact tool box to create a data connection.
with sql you can only run the program once, so make sure to run after youve successfully cloned the application.
after running the app, your data connection should show the tables in the sqlite toolbox
By running this app, the code will create a table that displays the information including the names, channels, and descriptions of hololive english members.
While I do not think that this project meets the requirements I was able to figure out what I was trying to do, but struggled to really do anything else to add to it.
It's not really fancy or indepth, but I was happy I was able to create what I had it mind.
I'm not sure this will pass, but I learned a lot working on this project. Regardless if this doesn't pass I would like to retake the class.
